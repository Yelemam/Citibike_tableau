# Overview

This project analyzes Citi Bike usage data to gain insights into station popularity, rider patterns, and peak usage times. The project was created as part 
of a data analytics challenge using Tableau Public, with interactive visualizations to explore ride data.

# Project Objectives

    • Identify the most popular Citi Bike stations based on ride count.
    • Analyze daily and hourly usage trends.
    • Compare member vs. casual rider behavior.
    • Visualize station popularity and peak usage times on an interactive map
    
# Data Source

The data used in this analysis includes:

    • Ride information: Start and end stations, ride duration, ride type, etc.
    • Date and time details: Ride start and end timestamps, allowing for analysis of daily and hourly trends.

# Key Visualizations

    1.Total Daily Trips: Line chart showing the total number of trips per day to understand daily demand.
    2.Most Popular Starting Stations: A map of starting stations with a heat overlay for the top locations.
    3.Top 10 Starting and Ending Stations: Bar charts showing the most frequented stations.
    4.Peak Usage Hours: Line chart displaying the busiest hours for Citi Bike usage.
    5.Rider Patterns: Bar chart comparing the count of rides by member type (member vs. casual).

# Insights

    • Station Popularity: High-traffic stations, such as those near business districts, are heavily utilized by commuters.
    • Usage Patterns: Peak hours for Citi Bike usage align with typical commuting hours, especially in the mornings and evenings.
    • Rider Demographics: Members contribute significantly more to ride count than casual riders, indicating high usage by regular commuters.
